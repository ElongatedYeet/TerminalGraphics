# TerminalGraphics

A 2D/3D Terminal Graphics , as there wasn't enough already. 

It can render 2D objects (Triangles), render some 3D objects (FOV is odd). 

Edit the main.cpp file to program in your own animations. Not the best system, but this is in really early testing stages. 
If you want to fix something, go fix it. If you dont want fix something, that's ok as well.
